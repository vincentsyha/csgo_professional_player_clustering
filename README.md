# CS:GO Player Cluster Analysis

The most recent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) major tournament announced a first ever $1,000,000 first place prize pool for the winning team. I figured it would be pertinent to develop a tool for coaches and team managers to utilize when trying to put together their next million dollar winning team lineup.

This project aims to utilize machine learning models to cluster players based on their historical performance. Allowing the end user to identify which players perform most closely to other players.

The dataset used to train and test the model can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mateusdmachado/csgo-professional-matches). The range of the dataset covers professional matches from 11/2015 to 03/2020.
